# Portfolio
A collection of previous projects, class work, and my [personal resume](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vRrCcVSl5TFn2jpMTRvKxNGnPYQiciaPwAAd5AZmg1q7Hco-m4r3ZfW74ujzIGQkwk3mRRN0bjpowYo/pub).

# Algorithms
I chose to add all my coding assignments from my algorithms class because it was my favorite class 
and the level of difficulty provided an amazing opportunity to learn new topics like iterative vs.
recursive algorithms, recursive relations, and algortihm classification. I also believe these
assignments allowed me to reach the learning goals set out by Westminster College and the Computer
Science Department. For the college wide learning goals critical thinking and creativity were key to
my success in the class, problems were difficult and required both of those skills to complete the
work properly. As for the Computer Science Department goals, these assignments require I develop problem solving
skills by applying what I have learned in other classes to determine a solution that is efficient and pratical.

# Pacman Project
I chose this project because this is one of the more cohesive collections of assignments I have,
this was from my Artificial Intelligence class. This was my first introduction to coding in python,
which I believe provided a great way to develop and understand more advanced algorithms
without the extra baggage of java syntax. These three assignments gave me a chance to learn
about search algorithms, simple intelligent agents, develop more complex algorithms, and use
my already existing skills to solve the problem at hand.

# Software Engineering Project
This is my group project from Software Engineering. I chose this project because it was the
largest and most challenging project I have completed thus far, and it was my first time working
on a long term project with a group. My group was tasked with creating a game for elementary
students. We chose to create a web application that was connected to a database which stored
game scores, class list, and our math questions. This gave me opportunities to self learn new
skills used in software development, as well as providing an opportunity to learn what it's like to
work with a team of developers, how to plan how you're going to develop software, and how to
organize your work output as a team.
