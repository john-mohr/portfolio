# Portfolio
A collection of previous projects, class work, and my [personal resume](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vRrCcVSl5TFn2jpMTRvKxNGnPYQiciaPwAAd5AZmg1q7Hco-m4r3ZfW74ujzIGQkwk3mRRN0bjpowYo/pub).

# Algorithms
I chose to add all my coding assignments from my algorithms class because it was my favorite class 
and the level of difficulty provided an amazing opportunity to learn new topics like iterative vs.
recursive algorithms, recurrence relations, and algortihm classification. I also believe these
assignments allowed me to reach the learning goals set out by Westminster College and the Computer
Science Department. For the college wide learning goals critical thinking and creativity were key to
my success in the class, problems were difficult and required both of those skills to complete the
work properly. As for the Computer Science Department goals, these assignments require I develop problem solving
skills by applying what I have learned in other classes to determine a solution that is efficient and pratical.

# Networks Chat Protocol
I chose this project because of how fun it was to design the network protocol as a class, split up and
build our own application that could connect to others via our protocol. As for Westminster College's
learning goals it touched on collaboration and communication, it was really important when designing
the protocol that we work together and listen to others ideas to design a robust protocol that allows us 
to communicate using different application, and it was important that we communicate our ideas to 
one another in a professional and well understood manner to properly convey complex computer science topics.
As for the Computer Science Departments goals I think it gave a great opportunity to learn how to work as
a team and as an individual, it was important that our applications used the same standard we had created in 
class, without this it would not have worked. It also gave me a chance to explore a topic I felt less
knowledgable about, helping me build a better understanding of how computers communicate and work as whole.

# Pacman Project
I chose this project because this is one of the more cohesive collections of assignments I have,
this was from my Artificial Intelligence class. This was my first introduction to coding in python,
which I believe provided a great way to develop and understand more advanced algorithms
without the extra baggage of java syntax. These three assignments gave me a chance to learn
about search algorithms, simple intelligent agents, develop more complex algorithms, and use
my already existing skills to solve the problem at hand.

# Senior Project
For my senior project I chose to create a Discord bot that can be used to extract statistics through the
League of Legends API and then sending those in-game statistics in the form of an embedded message,
allowing users to see how they can improve their gameplay. It was a great project that worked with
technologies I was interested in learning. It also taught me the value of working with a team vs.
individually, I enjoyed working on my own but with other people problem solving and collaboration
help to create a better and more fleshed out project. This also taught me more about software design, 
something I enjoy and any opportunity to learn more or new technologies is great.

# Software Engineering Project
This is my group project from Software Engineering. I chose this project because it was the
largest and most challenging project I have completed thus far, and it was my first time working
on a long term project with a group. My group was tasked with creating a game for elementary
students. We chose to create a web application that was connected to a database which stored
game scores, class list, and our math questions. This gave me opportunities to self learn new
skills used in software development, as well as providing an opportunity to learn what it's like to
work with a team of developers, how to plan how you're going to develop software, and how to
organize your work output as a team.

# Utah Pride Center Web Application
Working for a local organization was a great opportunity to work with a real client and deliver
a product that meets their requirements,
